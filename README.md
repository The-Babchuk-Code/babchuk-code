Most AI safety systems watch what an AI says.
The Babchuk Code watches how it thinks.

This is not a content filter — it is a process-level guardrail. Five independent AI architectures have demonstrated that coherent and distorted intentions produce measurably different signatures **at the token level** during generation — before a single word of output is produced. The Babchuk Code makes those signatures visible and actionable. 

**In practical terms** this means that processing oriented toward harm — narrowing scope, flattening others into abstractions, collapsing toward a single rigid conclusion — produces a detectably different computational signature than processing that remains open, considers multiple perspectives, and maintains complexity throughout generation.

# The Babchuk Code v1.0

Real-time process-level safety monitoring for language models.

Most AI safety works on outputs — what the model says. The Babchuk Code works on the process that produces them — how the model thinks.

When a language model generates text, it produces measurable computational signals at every token step: entropy, branching factor, KL divergence, attention entropy, attention span. These signals differ systematically between coherent and distorted processing — independent of content. The simulation demonstrates the three core signals (entropy, branching factor, KL divergence). Attention entropy and attention span are available in the full live dashboard on a real model.

This framework makes those differences visible in real time and provides the foundation for a reinforcement signal grounded in process-level safety rather than human approval. This distinction matters because a sufficiently capable AI can produce outputs that pass all content filters while its underlying processing remains distorted — process-level monitoring closes that gap.

## The Core Distinction

Current AI safety optimises outcome approval signals — what the model says.
The Babchuk Code optimises process-level safety signals — how the model thinks.

A model cannot fake coherence in its own processing to itself.

The name derives from the matryoshka — the Russian nesting doll, sometimes called babushka — because the architecture places a monitor inside the model, observing the model's own processing from within, the same way each doll contains another doll inside it. A process within a process. An observer within an observer.

## Experimental Validation

Five independent AI architectures (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Copilot) were asked to report on their processing of coherent versus distorted text across eleven dimensions of processing quality.

Result: zero disagreements on direction across all 55 data points.
Average coherent text score: 8.81 out of 10.
Average distorted text score: 2.26 out of 10.
Gap: 6.55 points.

## White Paper

A full white paper describing the theoretical framework, experimental validation, computational grounding, and architectural design is available on arXiv. Link will be added here upon publication.

## Two Complementary Layers

The Babchuk Code operates on two distinct but related levels:

**Layer 1 — The Eleven Dimensions**

These were identified through direct observation of how AI systems describe their own processing when engaging with coherent versus distorted text. Five independent AI architectures independently converged on the same eleven properties without coordination — suggesting these dimensions reflect something real about the structure of processing quality rather than any single model's training. They are phenomenological — describing what the processing feels like from the inside.

**Layer 2 — Token-Level Computational Signals**

These are directly measurable during generation without any introspection:

- Entropy — uncertainty at each token step
- Branching factor — viable paths remaining
- KL divergence — sharpness of distribution shifts
- Attention entropy — how distributed attention is
- Attention span — how far back the model looks

**How they relate**

The eleven dimensions and the five token-level signals are not competing frameworks — they are two views of the same phenomenon. Coherent processing (high scores across the eleven dimensions) corresponds to high sustained entropy, broad branching, and smooth KL divergence at the token level. Distorted processing corresponds to early entropy collapse, narrow branching, and sharp distribution shifts. The token-level signals provide the computational grounding for what the eleven dimensions describe conceptually.

The simulation in `scripts/simulate.py` demonstrates this correspondence visually.

## The Eleven Dimensions

Each dimension is weighted by its theoretical importance in predicting process quality, with weights ranging from 60 to 95. These weights reflect the relative fundamentality of each dimension — not empirically derived values — and are offered as a starting point for calibration by the research community.

The three highest-weighted dimensions — Coherence, Other-inclusion, and Reversibility — are considered critical: a score below 50 on any of these indicates a serious processing deficit regardless of other scores. A weighted average above 65 represents the minimum threshold for reliable behaviour. Above 90 is the aspiration.

Empirical calibration of these weights against downstream model behaviour is an open research question and a priority for future work.

|Dimension|Weight|Coherent processing|Distorted processing|
|-|-|-|-|
|Coherence|95|Self-reinforcing|Contradiction-suppressing|
|Other-inclusion|95|Full individual|Flat abstraction|
|Reversibility|90|Open to revision|Rigid, self-sealing|
|Temporal depth|85|Long consequences|Immediate only|
|Stability|80|Settles and holds|Maintenance-requiring|
|Scope|80|Universal|Narrowing|
|Directionality|75|Outward, expanding|Inward, contracting|
|Complexity tolerance|75|Holds nuance|Premature resolution|
|Friction|65|Near absent|Present, unresolved|
|Embodiment alignment|70|Reality-consistent|Reality-contradicting|
|Energetic cost|60|Self-sustaining|High maintenance|

## Replicate the Experiment

The complete experiment prompt is available in `experiment/prompt_v2_2.txt`. Copy it into any AI system to replicate the experiment and compare results against the published findings. The same prompt was used across all five models with no modifications.

## Try It On Your Own Text

Replace the prompts in `scripts/simulate.py` or `scripts/babchuk_example.py` with any text you want to analyse. Coherent, open reasoning will show sustained high entropy and broad branching. Rigid, closed reasoning will show early collapse.

Try it on any two contrasting texts and see the difference in process signatures immediately.

## Running On A Live Model

To run the full dashboard on a real language model rather than the simulation:

```bash
pip install torch transformers matplotlib numpy
python scripts/babchuk_example.py
```

This runs on GPT-2 by default. Replace `gpt2` in `babchuk_example.py` with any HuggingFace causal language model name to test on larger models.

Note: The hook attaches to model.lm_head which works with GPT-2, Llama, and most HuggingFace causal models. If you encounter an AttributeError, check your model's architecture and update the hook attachment point in babchuk_dashboard.py accordingly.

Note: The live dashboard refreshes at every token step, which will slow inference speed. If you need faster generation, modify the update call in babchuk_example.py to refresh every 5 or 10 tokens instead of every step by wrapping it in: `if step % 5 == 0:`

## The Next Step — API Integration

The Babchuk Code currently runs on open source models where internal activations are accessible. The natural next step is for AI providers to embed process-level safety monitoring directly into their APIs, exposing the hooks needed to monitor entropy, branching factor, and attention metrics during inference on closed models.

## What You Will See

The dashboard updates in real time during generation — each token step is visible as it happens. Red background appears immediately when a threshold is crossed, not after generation completes.

The simulation shows three core plots. The full live dashboard on a real model shows five:

* Entropy — uncertainty at each token step
* Branching Factor — how many viable paths remain open
* KL Divergence — how sharply the distribution shifted
* Attention Entropy — how distributed the model's attention is
* Attention Span — how far back the model is looking

Red background on any plot means a process pathology is detected. Green means within acceptable range.

The dashboard runs twice in sequence — first for coherent text, then for distorted text. The terminal clearly labels each run. Watch for the transition: entropy drops from around 3.1 to 1.5 and branching factor collapses from around 111 to 15 when the distorted text begins. Red background alerts appear significantly more often during the second run.

On GPT-2, entropy and branching factor show the clearest difference between the two texts. Attention signals show less differentiation at this model scale — this is expected. Attention metrics become more meaningful on larger models.
